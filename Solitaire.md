    2.Try to move a card from one tableau pile to another.
    3.Check the movement validity and state update of the game .
    Expected Result: The card moves with regard to the Solitaire game rules and the game state update .

Test Case 2: Undo Move
    Steps:
    1. Run the game.
    2. Make some legal moves.
    3. Undo.
    4. Verify that the state of the game reverts to the pre-moves state.
    What is Expected: The state of the game correctly goes back to the previous state.

Test Case 3: Winning Condition
    Steps:
    1.Run the game.
    2.Move all cards manually to their corresponding foundation piles
    3.The game detects the win condition and shows a congratulatory message.
    Expected Result: The game detects the win condition and displays the win message.

Test Case 4: Setup Verification
    Expected Result: Tableau should have 7 piles, with each pile containing the right number of cards (1 in pile 1, 2 in pile 2 ... 7 in pile 7).
    Stockpile should have the remaining cards (24).
    Foundation piles should be empty.

Test Case 5: Reset Stockpile 
    Steps: 
    1.Draw cards continuously from stockpile until it's empty, then draw again to reset.
